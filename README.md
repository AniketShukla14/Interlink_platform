## Description
### "Background: As of now, we donâ€™t have master data base regarding students at various levels, without which framing policies with regard to education and upliftment of student community is difficult. Provision of common platform in which the entire data base of school education, higher education and technical education are interlinked, which will help the government to identify the grey areas where actual concentration is needed. Further, the percentage of students entering various fields of education and percentage of student drop outs also can be identified and also State/District wise drop outs can be identified and thereby these places can be targeted for improvement. Summary: An integrated platform should be developed for the integration of School education, Higher education and technical education in India. This will help in: 1. Better synchronization between the agencies controlling School education, Higher education and Technical education. 2. Access to real time data for framing policies related to School education, Higher education and Technical education 3. Integration in all these three verticals Objective: : To develop an Interlinked platform for School education, Higher education and Technical education in India"
